# Bug Fixes Report

This report documents 3 bugs found and fixed in the codebase.

## Bug 1: Security Vulnerability - API Keys Stored in Plain Text

**Location**: `src/components/video-studio/components/video-key-dialog.tsx`

**Type**: Security Vulnerability

### Problem
API keys for various services (Fal AI, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Replicate) were being stored in plain text in localStorage. This is a serious security vulnerability because:
- localStorage is accessible by any JavaScript code running on the page
- Third-party scripts or XSS attacks could steal these sensitive credentials
- Browser extensions can read localStorage data
- API keys are visible in browser developer tools

### Solution
Implemented basic obfuscation for API keys before storing them in localStorage:
- Added `encodeKey()` and `decodeKey()` functions that use base64 encoding with string reversal
- Modified the component to encode keys before storage and decode them when reading
- Added warning comments about this being a temporary solution
- **Note**: This is NOT secure encryption - it's just basic obfuscation. In production, API keys should be stored server-side and accessed through authenticated endpoints.

### Code Changes
- Added encoding/decoding functions
- Modified localStorage key names to include `_encoded` suffix
- Updated all localStorage operations to use the encoding functions

## Bug 2: Memory Leak - Uncleared Interval in Auto-Save System

**Location**: `src/lib/auto-save/auto-save-system.ts`

**Type**: Memory Leak / Performance Issue

### Problem
The performance monitoring interval created in `setupPerformanceMonitoring()` was never cleaned up. This caused:
- Memory leak as the interval continues running indefinitely
- Unnecessary CPU usage even after the auto-save system is no longer needed
- Potential accumulation of multiple intervals if the system is reinitialized
- Console logs continuing after the component is unmounted

### Solution
Properly tracked and cleaned up the performance monitoring interval:
- Added `performanceMonitoringInterval` property to store the interval reference
- Modified `setupPerformanceMonitoring()` to store the interval ID
- Updated `cleanup()` method to clear the performance monitoring interval
- Also improved the cleanup method to properly clear all intervals and event listeners

### Code Changes
- Added `private performanceMonitoringInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;`
- Stored interval reference: `this.performanceMonitoringInterval = setInterval(...)`
- Added cleanup code to clear the interval and remove event listeners

## Bug 3: Logic Error - Unsafe String Operations

**Location**: `src/app/studios/my-assets/page.tsx`

**Type**: Logic Error / Runtime Exception Risk

### Problem
The code performed string operations without null/undefined checks in two places:
1. `asset.content_type.split('/')` - Could throw if `content_type` is null/undefined
2. Date formatting could fail and cause issues with `.split(',')` operation

These issues could cause:
- Runtime errors crashing the application
- Poor user experience with broken functionality
- Unpredictable behavior with malformed data

### Solution
Added proper defensive programming:
1. **For content_type splitting**: Added null checks and type validation before splitting
   - Default to 'jpg' extension if content_type is missing
   - Safely extract extension with proper bounds checking
2. **For date formatting**: Added try-catch to handle invalid dates
   - Return a safe default format that can always be split
   - Prevents crashes from invalid date strings

### Code Changes
- Replaced inline split with safe extraction logic
- Added try-catch in formatDate function
- Ensured all string operations have proper guards

## Summary

These fixes address critical issues in the codebase:
1. **Security**: Improved (though not fully secured) API key storage
2. **Performance**: Fixed memory leak in auto-save system
3. **Stability**: Prevented potential runtime errors from unsafe string operations

### Recommendations for Further Improvements
1. Implement proper server-side API key management
2. Add comprehensive error boundaries throughout the application
3. Implement proper TypeScript strict null checks
4. Add unit tests for edge cases in data handling
5. Consider using a more robust state management solution for sensitive data
